## Key Features

- **Dependency Injection and Layered Architecture:** Our application is designed with a layered approach, facilitating communication between layers through Dependency Injection. This not only adheres to the DRY principle but also promotes encapsulation and simplifies testing.

- **Asynchronous Programming:** Leveraging asynchronous programming techniques, we ensure improved performance for a responsive user experience.

- **Database Management:** Utilizing SQL Database and EntityFrameworkCore in the DatabaseFirst method, we've streamlined data handling for efficiency.

- **DTO Layer and Object Mapping:** Employing a dedicated DTO layer helps in encapsulation, eliminating circular dependencies and flattening objects. Object mapping is seamlessly handled through the AutoMapper library.

- **Configurability:** We understand the importance of flexibility. Our application allows easy modification of crucial information through configuration files.

- **Logging and Error Handling:** Nlog is employed for comprehensive logging, with the added feature of email notifications in case of errors.
  
- **Middlewares:**  for Rating and error handling .

- **Password Strength:** Security is a top priority. We've implemented the zxcvbn-core library to enforce robust password policies.
  
- **Swagger Documentation:** To enhance transparency and usability, the application is thoroughly documented using Swagger.
